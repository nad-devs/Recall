        "details": "The problem of validating parentheses involves ensuring that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and that they are correctly nested. The stack data structure is ideal for this task because it follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, which matches the requirement of closing the most recently opened bracket first. The process begins by iterating through each character in the string. If an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty, which would indicate an unmatched closing bracket, and returns false if so. Otherwise, it checks if the top of the stack contains the matching opening bracket. If it does, the top element is popped from the stack. If not, the string is invalid, and false is returned. After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if the string is valid, indicating all brackets were matched and closed correctly. This approach efficiently handles the problem with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, as each character is processed once.",
