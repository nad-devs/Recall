# Notes AI - Pre-Production Testing Checklist

This checklist ensures all features are working correctly before deploying to production.

- [ ] Header navigation works (Browse Concepts, Conversations, Get Started)
- [ ] Hero section displays properly with animations
- [ ] Feature cards render correctly

## üß† Core AI Features

### Concept Extraction
- [ ] Navigate to `/concepts` page
- [ ] "Analyze New Conversation" button works
- [ ] Text input accepts conversation content
- [ ] AI extraction process completes successfully
- [ ] Extracted concepts display correctly
- [ ] Categories are assigned properly
- [ ] Confidence scores are reasonable (0.5-1.0)
- [ ] Related concepts are identified
- [ ] Code snippets are extracted when present

### Test Conversation Examples
Use these test conversations to verify extraction:

**Test 1: React Hooks**
```
I was learning about React hooks today. useState is used for managing state in functional components. You call it with an initial value and it returns an array with the current state and a setter function. useEffect is for side effects like API calls or subscriptions. It runs after every render by default, but you can control when it runs with a dependency array.
```

**Test 2: AWS IAM**
```
AWS IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions. They have statements with Effect (Allow/Deny), Action (what can be done), and Resource (what it applies to). You can attach policies to users, groups, or roles. The principle of least privilege means giving minimal permissions needed.
```

**Test 3: Algorithm Discussion**
```
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding elements in sorted arrays. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. Time complexity is O(log n) and space complexity is O(1) for iterative implementation. The key insight is that you can eliminate half the possibilities with each comparison.
```
